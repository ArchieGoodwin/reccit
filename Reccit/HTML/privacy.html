Your Personal Information</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times","serif"'>You may view or
edit your personal information and preferences by visiting the Website and
logging into your Reccit account (the &quot;Reccit Account&quot;). From your
Reccit Account, you can choose to receive or stop the delivery of future
newsletters, email, and surveys from Reccit. Please note that this does not
apply to the display of online advertising, nor to the receipt of mandatory
service communications that are considered part of the Services. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:22.0pt;font-family:"Times","serif"'>Collection
of Your Personal Information</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times","serif"'>When you open a
Reccit Account, we ask you to provide certain information, such as your name,
email address, (collectively, the “Personal Information”). We may also collect
general demographic information, such as your age, gender, ZIP code,
preferences, and interests. We may also collect information about your visit to
the Website, such as pages viewed, links clicked and other similar navigation
action in connection with the Website, location information, and browser
information, such as your browser type, IP address, and access times. We treat
non-personally identifiable data as non-Personal Information, except where we
are required to do otherwise under applicable law. We may provide aggregate
information to our partners about how our users use the Website, so that our
partners may also understand how often people use their services and our
Service. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times","serif"'>When you receive
promotional emails or newsletters from Reccit, we may use customized links or
similar technologies to determine whether such newsletters or email has been

of Your Personal Information</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times","serif"'>Reccit collects
and uses your Personal Information and non-Personal Information to operate and
improve the Website and better deliver the Services, including, but not limited
to performing analysis, making the Website or Services more user friendly by
reducing the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information, and
displaying advertising and content that are tailored to your preferences and
interests. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times","serif"'>Reccit may support
the Website and the Service by advertising, and accordingly, we may use some of
the information collected in order to customize the advertisements to your
interests and preferences. However, the process of selecting customized ads
tailored to you will use data that does not personally identify you, such as
using demographic data such as ZIP code, interests or location. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times","serif"'>We also use your
Personal Information to provide you with mandatory notices or discretionary
notices about the Service. From time to time, we may also send you surveys or
promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from
Reccit and its affiliates. </span></p>

Information and non-Personal Information collected by Reccit may be stored and
processed in the United States or any other country in which Reccit or its

described in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will be used only
by Reccit and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates, and your Personal
Information will not be disclosed to any other third party without your
consent. By accessing your Reccit Account, you may choose to share your
Personal Information with select Reccit partners so that they can contact you
about their respective products, services or offers. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times","serif"'>Reccit may hire
other companies to provide limited infrastructural and communication services
on our behalf, such as hosting websites, the processing and delivery of
mailings, providing customer support system, or performing statistical analysis
of the Services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only such
information as necessary for them to deliver the service. Those companies are
required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited
from using it for any other purpose. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times","serif"'>Reccit may access
and/or disclose Personal Information about you or your account without your
prior consent if Reccit has a good faith belief that such action is necessary
to: (i) comply with legal process or other legal requirements of any
governmental authority; (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of
Reccit (including the enforcement of our agreements); (iii) enforce the Terms
of Service, which can be accessed at </span><a href="http://www.roam7.com/terms"><span

of Your Personal Information</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times","serif"'>The Personal
Information Reccit collects is securely stored within our database, and we use
standard, industry-wide practices such as firewalls, encryption, and (in
certain areas) Secure Socket Layers (&quot;SSL&quot;) for protecting your

system is impenetrable. Reccit cannot guarantee the security of our database,
nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while
being transmitted to Reccit over the Internet. </span></p>
